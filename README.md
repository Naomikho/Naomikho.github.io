# Naomikho's Personal Website
Created using ReactJS and hosted using githubwebpages.

#Purpose
The purpose of this website is to display my ability to create a website using React and to introduce myself and my projects.
During my previous role as a front end developer in an employer project, I was lacking in the part of UI development and failed to adhere to responsive and grid design rules. Hence, I decided to adopt a mobile-first design in my website to ensure that the website can correctly display content on mobiles. Components' sizes will also vary depending on the viewport size in order to adapt to various devices, which is something that I also was not able to fulfill last time(I was only able to adapt to common desktop viewport resolutions). 

I also decided to employ a cleaner folder structure this time(for a small project) to streamline my work. I will also aim to refactor my code whenever possible to achieve the cleanest possible code structure.
